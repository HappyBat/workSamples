        <P> In the United Kingdom AD(H)D affects about ​3-5%​ of children and ​2%​ of adults. That means in a
            class of 20 to 35 kids, chances are at least one of them has AD(H)D. Can you think of 50adult relatives,
            friends,
            colleagues or acquaintances? Chances are, at least one of them will have AD(H)D, too. Chances also are, they
            do not know
            they have it. Experts estimate that three quarters of all adults with AD(H)D are undiagnosed. They might
            struggle in
            life, not knowing they could seek help and effective treatment. In fact, people with AD(H)D are over seven
            times ​more
            likely to attempt suicide​ and ten times more likely to complete it.</P>

        <P>
            But what does it mean for adults to have AD(H)D? Let us imagine a few hypothetical but probable scenarios.
        </P>
        <P>
            Picture the following situation:
        </P>
        <p style="margin:0px 20px 0px 20px;"><I>Your employee and co-worker Brian has stayed at the office overnight for three days in a row. He hardly
                ate anything and
                is not seen by anyone unless they
                enter his office. In fact, he does not even change his posture. He seems to be so deep into his new
                project that even
                the deafening noise of the building site leaves him undisturbed. If spoken to, he barely reacts nor
                remembers any
                conversation attempt there might have been. When on the fourth day he stands at your door with a spacey
                look and
                bloodshot eyes, the project, which was scheduled to be completed in two months, is finished...
            </I>
        </p>
        <p>
            Brian has Attention Deficit
            Hyperactivity Disorder (AD(H)D).
        </p>
        <P>

        </P>
        <P>You would not have thought so? No wonder, the term of this disability is heavily
            misleading.Individuals with AD(H)D do not lack attention, they struggle in regulating it. Hans
            Biegert,school director
            of a very successful private school in Germany that has a special teaching approach for pupils with AD(hH)D,
            explains it
            like this:</P>
        <p><i>“AD(H)D is, in its essence, a self-regulatory disorder. It is not concentration but impulse and attention
                regulation that are disrupted.“</i></p>

        <h2>“I messed it all up” - AD(H)D at the workplace</h2>
        <p style="margin:0px 20px 0px 20px;"><i>You, as Brian’s boss, might feel quite ambivalent towards him: He has
                periods of extreme productivity and he helps the company advance with his flow of ideas and creativity.
                But he also
                rushes into the office ten minutes late every day, he procrastinates projects dangerously long and is
                unable to
                prioritise
                tasks. He forgets deadlines and makes careless mistakes in many projects. At one point, the survival of
                the company
                was
                at stake because he had sent an email containing a corporate secret to the wrong recipient. Should you
                fire him?</i>
        </p>
        <p>Decreased activity of the dopaminergic reward system in individuals with ADHD translates <i>“into problems in
        engaging in
        activities
        that are not inherently rewarding or reinforcing.”</i> say studies​. <i>“​Positive feedback can help sustaining
                attention,”</i>
            ​says Biegert, who uses this knowledge to help children at his school. ​ <i>"That is why children with
                AD(H)D can focus
                on their Gameboy, PlayStation and Nintendo for hours on end – they constantly generate feedback.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>rarely get accommodations in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>Neurological differences create obstacles for people with AD(H)D not only in their personal life, but also in
            their
            professional life, as they
        </p>
        <p>Person C, who has inattentive ADHD as well, has had​ <i>“a hundred”</i> ​jobs,
            ranging from hotel management to building theatre sets to having a takeaway business, being a
            runner,production manager,
            art director, manager, accountant executive, insurance sales agent or hypnotherapist. <i>​“In the beginning”</i> he
            says, <i>“I
            was
            the blue-eyed boy and then things fell apart as I made a mistake or had forgotten something. Emotional
            dysregulation
            and underperformance were also an issue at work.”</i> ​After his diagnosis, person C says, <i>“​I got into a short
            depression
            because I was mourning all the lost opportunities in my life. I had job opportunities that other people
            could only dream
            about, but I messed it all up”</i>.
        </p>

        <p><i>“I started to compensate for my ADHD by working additional hours,”</i> s​ays person
            F.<i>“​Consequently, I did not have any time or energy left to try strategies that help my ADHD, like sports.
            There was a
            time when I worked twelve to thirteen hours a day. With more and
            more hours in the office, I would manage to do less and less so that I would stay even longer."</i>
        </p>

        <p>Individuals with ​AD(H)D also have a distorted perception of time​, or time blindness, that leads to
            difficulties in
            time estimation. They also
            have ​slower processing speed​: the speed in which a person can understand and react to the information they
            receive.</p>


        <p>Person A says ​<i>“I push myself to an impossible level to get everything done and compensate for the ADHDness
        in
        me. I compensate for my lateness by being very good at everything else.”​</i>Person B says <i>“​I honestly think
            that things
            take less time than they do. I have been late every day but every day I believe that I would be at my
            destination by the
            time I am, in fact,leaving my house. It’s depressing.​”</i>
        </p>

        <p>There are not many accommodations for someone with AD(H)D in the
            workplace. <i>“Autism is quite popular in a way” Cardiff researcher Syed points out, “there are accommodations
            for it and
            people understand the issues to a certain degree. AD(H)D, however, is like the poor cousin of autism.”</i>
            <i>“​People go like
            oh you have autism, so we have to adjust lots of things for you​”</i> says person A, <i>“​AD(H)D, however, is seen
            as a
            behaviour problem.​​ But it is a neurological difference.​ Our brains work in a different way​.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>Person A says it would be
            great if she could let someone live though ADHD for one day.​ <i>“Iwould say ‘try and live a normal day. Go to
            work, drop
            the kids of, make dinner, try to do all of those things – all with my brain. ENJOY!’ I think people could
            not believe
            it.
            They would say ‘No that’s not possible.’ I think people would be absolutely exhausted and not get a lot of
            things done.
            Most people would find it unbearable. They would be begging for their brains back.”</i>
        </p>

        <h2>“Megafocus” - a surprising
            phenomenon</h2>
        <p>However, among all those struggles there is one phenomenon that can help people with attention regulation
            problems and that occurs especially in those with more severe symptoms. It is colloquially termed as
            ‘hyperfocus’.
            Hyperfocus means to be so intensely focused on something, that one is no longer aware of the outer world or
            even
            personal
            physical needs. This can lead to heightened productiveness, but it can also lead to neglecting crucial
            tasks,
            appointments or meetings. Hyperfocus has been the subject of research, despite it not being listed among the
            diagnostic
            criteria for AD(H)D.</p>


        <p><i>“People will always say ‘how can you know so much about this?’ and I reply: because I havejust spent
        four days thinking about nothing else!” ​says person A. “​ADHD means that when Iam remotely interested in
        something I
        become obsessive about it.”</i>
        </p>

        <p><i>“​I get megafocus.”</i>​ says person G. <i>“​I can get more focused on things than anyone. During
        mylaw degree hyperfocus helped me to get the result that I did.”</i>
        </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, people with AD(H)D do not naturally have
            control over their hyperfocus, as they do not have control over their attention in general. That is why
            someone with
            AD(H)D might start a project overly enthusiastically (“hyperfocused”) but lose interest in it quite soon.
            Person A says:
            “​I can focus on things if I enjoy them but if something is not engaging it is so hard, it is almost
            physically painful​.
            ​And it is some sort of internal thing that I cannot choose, that I don’t have any control over. I know it
            cannot feel
            like that to neurotypical people because no one would do anything!”
        </p>

        <h2>“It always seems to others that you are being negligent, you are being rude​.​”</h2>
        <p>AD(H)D does not only lead to troubles at work, but also to problems in social
            relationships.This is usually sobering for both parties involved, as one feels unappreciated and neglected
            and the other
            gets increasingly desperate with their unsuccessful attempts to change their behaviour.
        </p>
        <p><i>“​Compatibility of relationships is the biggest problem for me​” says person G who says his breakup with his
        wife was
        mainly due to his ADHD symptoms.”</i><i>“​It always seems to others that you are being negligent, you are being rude​.”</i>        
        </p>

        <p><i>“​Someone will say something, and you are
        distracted and not give the attention that they crave and they interpret it as not being interested
        enough.​”</i> Says
            person
            C.</p>


        <p>Many people with AD(H)D have​​Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria​ (RSD). It is an extreme emotional pain caused by
            the
            belief that you have disappointed others in your life and they
            consequently withdrew their love or respect. <i>“​People were probably hurt because I just had no self-esteem
            and I dropped
            them because I didn’t see I was adding any value or they could possibly feel hurt​”</i> says person C, who is
            affected by
            this feeling.</p>

        <p>RSD does not come as a surprise if you consider that those with ADHD receive ​20,000 more negative messages
            by age 12 than those without the condition​. They view themselves as fundamentally different and flawed.
        </p>

        <h2>“Oh, I also get
            distracted sometimes”</h2>
        <p>If this was not hard enough, one must not forget about the stigma. A recent ​study concluded that
            the overwhelming majority of adults with AD(H)D had doubts about the validity of AD(H)D as a mental
            disorder. They
            perceived public stigma and discrimination,which caused them to suffer more psychological distress,
            self-esteem issues,
            functional impairment and decreased quality of life. In general, it made their ‘burden of disease’ much
            heavier.
        </p>
        <p><i>“​When I
        first took the medication it was like a reset.”​</i> says person A.​ <i>"The inside of my head was so much quieter,
        I could
        focus
        and even be in time. Then my mother and I went to a parent evening and all the teachers said ‘what has
        changed? Your
        daughter is a different girl, we knew she had the potential and finally she is applying herself’ and I said
        ‘that’s because I’m on drugs.’ And I told them it was because I’ve got ADHD and I was medicated and they
        would say ‘No,
        not ADHD surely’. They could see this massive change but they still could not believe it. It was so
        frustrating.”</i>
        </p>
        <p><i>“The
        attitude towards AD(H)D is still not very good and a lot of stigma is attached to it in the media.”</i> says
            researcher
            Syed.
            People with AD(H)D often get to hear phrases like <i>“Oh, I also get distracted sometimes”</i> or <i>“Yeah, I’m like
            that, always
            forgetting things...”</i>, which can feel quite belittling for someone who is seriously affected by these
            dispositions.
        </p>
        <p>“All
            of us have some of it to some degree but for someone with AD(H)D it is like that ALL the time, 24/7. It
            causes
            disruptions in their everyday life, from impeding them to focus, to
            hindering them to manage their relationships and their money.” says Syed. That is the difference.
        </p>

        <h2>AD(H)D is clearly underdiagnosed, especially in girls and women</h2>

        <P>Now, imagine our final example:</P>
        <P style="margin:0px 20px 0px 20px;"><i>You are Lucy, a 12-year-old girl. You are
                daydreaming in classes and missing nearly everything. Somehow though, you manage to keep up and do well
                in school.Eight
                years later, you find yourself at university. Suddenly, you are required to organise yourself. No one
                checks the
                homework, gives you feedback or does the laundry for you. Your room gets messy, no matter how hard you
                try to prevent
                it.
                You are too ashamed to allow people to visit. Often you are so late for lectures, that you decide not to
                go at all. If
                you manage to, you cannot ignore all the noise around you. Your brain shuts down.
            </i>
        </P>
        <p><i>You forget appointments. You work
                several nights in a row before every deadline, given you realised there was a deadline. Your grades
                drop. You know you
                are far away from reaching up to your potential. One day, you cannot stand up from bed anymore. And the
                next day.And the
                next. After two weeks you go to the doctor, asking to get diagnosed for depression.
            </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>“​Adults with AD(H)D seldomly come to see a doctor or psychiatrist because of their core symptoms, but they
        come for
        disorders like substance abuse, depression
        or anxiety disorders,that derived from the AD(H)D in the first place​”</i> says Professor Lesch. <i>“That is
        shutting the stable
        door after the horse has already bolted.”</i> In fact, the discovery that many patients on the substance abuse
            station
            actually had AD(H)D as the primary condition, led Professor Lesch to research on the disorder.
        </p>

        <p><i>“​When I was studying law,
        I used Speed to do my assignments​”</i> says person G. <i>​“I self-medicated with drugs and drinking to try to
        achieve, to do
        things. It was not to lose my head or escape, it helped me to slow down and focus.​”</i>
        </p>

        <p>Person B, who had been a drug addict
            as well and was diagnosed when she was 50, says:<i>“​When I went to uni I just could not go to the library and
            could not
            understand why. And I
            was beating myself up all the time and could not understand why I could not get anything done. And I just
            kept repeating
            years and failing. It was a nightmare.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“​AD(H)D is clearly underdiagnosed, especially in girls and women,​”</i> says Lesch.
            They often internalise symptoms and are good at fitting into the social expectations. Moreover, they tend to
            not show
            hyperactive symptoms (they have ADD instead of ADHD). There would beat least twice as many patients with
            AD(H)D if
            everyone were diagnosed, he says. <i>“​The view of ADHD is predominantly male and negative​”</i> says Trudy.<i>“​I
            did not get
            diagnosed when I needed it, because I was, according to my GP ‘too academic, too bright and not disruptive
            enough.​”</i> 
        </p>
        <p><i>“I
            have known something is not quite right for a long time”</i> ​says person J.​ <i>"I had seven years of counselling
            and clinical
            supervision. I thought nothing seems to (bloody) work, why can’t I just be normal? Why do I find all those things so
            difficult? Then I discovered it was ADHD and now I feel more normal than I have ever felt in my whole life."</i>
</p>
        <p>The main
            problem in adults, Lesch says, is that they never reach their potential and there isa huge discrepancy
            between what they
            could and expect themselves to achieve and what they are actually achieving.
        </p>
        <p>Person B, who struggles to work or do
            anything without the presence of another person,says <i>“​Me, and the task, on my own, doesn’t work. I was
            always
            considered a brightunderachiever. When I am alone the tasks just feel vast and huge, I want to do it
            butsomehow, I can’t
            even start. I feel stuck, trapped. Every day is like a failure.”</i>
        </p>

        <h2>Diagnosis: one to ​five ​years waiting times</h2>
        <p>Person F,
            who was diagnosed with AD(H)D in Germany before she came to the UK says<i>“I was told that I had been
            diagnosed five years
            ago and managed to keep my job so it couldnot be that bad. It was 10 months until I got the diagnosis
            confirmed. When I was diagnosed in Germany, they told me the waiting time was ‘pretty long’ – around three months.”</i> ​
            
        </p>
        <p><i>“​I thought I might have
        autism,​” says person C, “​After a year and a half I got tested for it and they said I had no autism but
        recommended to
        get tested for ADHD. That took another year and a half.​”</i>
        </p>
        <p><i>“​I do not even remember,​”</i> says person B. <i>“​It took ages, a couple years, they kept forgetting</i>me.​”
        </p>

        <p>After the diagnosis,
            patients often feel left alone and they do not have the money and support to access the help that they need.
           <i>“​I pay 50
        pounds per month for the medication while waiting for the shared plan​” says person H. “​I need it. When I
        took it I
        experienced what a ‘focused mind’ is for the first time in my life!​”</i> 
        </p>
        <p><i>“​I would prefer therapy to pills​”</i> says person B
            <i>“​but I just can’t afford it.​”“​Therapy is the best thing I’ve done​” says person A “​and I know it is a
            privilege.​”</i>
        </p>
        <p>Now imagine someone with AD(H)D, diagnosed or undiagnosed, like Lucy in our example,under Corona
            conditions.</p>

        <p><i>“Corona was very hard.​”</i> Says person B. <i>“​My nice little world disappeared. I had to reinvent myself and then
        I realised I could not organise myself at all. All the routines broke away. And then the ADHD consultant
        never replied
        when I contacted him saying I was struggling.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>At first, it might not seem straightforward that people with AD(H)D should
            suffer disproportionately more from the COVID-19 pandemic than neurotypicals. One ​study conducted in China,
            however,
            comes to the result that <i>“during the COVID-19 outbreak,children’s ADHD behaviours significantly worsened”</i>
            They ascribe
            it to the <i>“loss of daily routine and the lack of interpersonal and social interaction.”</i> Given that ADHD runs
            in families
            it is very likely that AD(H)D parents have to cope with that.
        </p>

        <p>However, for some people with AD(H)D who continued to have
            some structure,Corona was a surprisingly positive experience.</p>

        <p><i>“​I loved Corona” ​says person A​. I feel like all I’ve
                ever wanted Is the world to stop fora bit so that I could catch up. I always feel so overwhelmed and
                busy and filled up
                in my head that all I’ve ever wanted is just for everything to stop​.” [Person A]</i></p>

        <h2>It’ not all bad</h2>
        <i>So, what did we learn from fictional Brian and Lucy and the people who told us about their AD(H)D?</i>
        <p>AD(H)D is a highly heritable attention regulation impediment that can be a quite debilitating factor in
            people’s lives.
            Most of the time, it
            remains unseen. It rarely occurs alone but together with other disorders and there is a lot of stigma
            attached to it.
        </p>
        <p>Is it all bad though? No, only people do not know that!
        </p>
        <p><i>“​The understanding and empathy for AD(H)D in the population is very
        limited, but so is the knowledge regarding the positive resources of it: creativity, the ability to think
        “outside the
        box” and enthusiasm​”</i> s​ays Professor Lesch.</p>


        <i>“I am very enthusiastic”</i> ​says person G.​ <i>“ADHD has helped me to create TV
            programmes. I have original ideas. To create anything new, that did not exist before, you have to think like
            that.”</i>
        <p><i>“If I ask you to name me 10 successful entrepreneurs”</i>​​says Biegert​ <i>“​the majority of those probably have
        AD(H)D. They
        overcome boundaries and create new opportunities. They have the courage to try things others would shy away
        from.”</i>
        </p>
        <p><i>“It is
        important not to disqualify it as a weakness of character​”</i> ​says Lesch.
        </p>
        <p>For the future, researcher Syed wishes for more
            support for people with AD(H)D:<i>“For adults it is especially stigmatising to go to the psychiatrist and
                seek help.
                If there was more support, people would be more likely to seek help.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>In the end, managing AD(H)D is a shared task between
            the individuals affected by it and society. As person J explains it to her son:​<i>“It is not your fault that
            you’ve got
            ADHD and it is not the other-people-around-you’s fault that you’ve got ADHD. You cannot allow your symptoms
            to impact on
            other people. You have to figure out how to manage them yourself,so they impact less on you and less on
            other people.”</i> 
        </p>
        <p><i>“I
        hope that there will be a day when I can just tell someone I have ADHD and not feel like I have to convince
        them or
        explain it or argue it with them.”</i> ​says person E.
            And person J suggests:<i>“Is it not about us managing it a bit and then them understanding us a bit so there
            is some type
            of middle ground?”</i> ​
